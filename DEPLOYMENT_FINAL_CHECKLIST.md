## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended for Quick Start)
```bash
cd /Users/shaight/claude-projects/soberlivings/frontend
npm run vercel-build
vercel deploy --prod
```

### Option 2: Docker (Full Control)
```bash
cd /Users/shaight/claude-projects/soberlivings/frontend
./scripts/deploy.sh production
```

### Option 3: AWS Infrastructure (Enterprise)
```bash
cd /Users/shaight/claude-projects/soberlivings/infrastructure/terraform
terraform plan -var-file="production.tfvars"
terraform apply
```

---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Verification

Run these commands before deployment:

```bash
# 1. Run health checks
./scripts/health-check.sh

# 2. Validate environment
./scripts/setup-env.sh validate

# 3. Test database connectivity
npm run test:health

# 4. Check Docker services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config

# 5. Run smoke tests
./scripts/smoke-tests.sh
```

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Before marking deployment as successful, verify:

1. **All health endpoints** return 200 OK
2. **API response times** < 2 seconds
3. **Database queries** < 100ms
4. **No error logs** in first 10 minutes
5. **Memory usage** stable under load
6. **SSL certificates** valid
7. **Monitoring dashboards** showing data
8. **Backup verification** successful
