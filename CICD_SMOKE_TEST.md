# ðŸ§ª CI/CD Pipeline Smoke Test

This file triggers the CI/CD pipeline to test environment-scoped secrets and deployment workflow.

## Test Results

- **Branch**: cicd-smoketest
- **Environment Secrets**: âœ… All 6 secrets configured
  - JWT_SECRET
  - DATABASE_URL
  - SUPABASE_URL
  - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
  - FIRECRAWL_API_KEY

## Expected Pipeline Behavior

1. **Staging Environment**: Should deploy automatically with staging secrets
2. **Production Environment**: Should require approval with production secrets
3. **Secret Access**: All environment variables should be accessible in workflows

## Verification

This smoke test validates:
- [x] Environment secrets are properly scoped
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline triggers on branch push
- [ ] Secrets are accessible in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Staging deployment works with environment secrets
- [ ] Production requires environment approval
